For your sake (and your plants) we will help you assess your home's lighting. Then, head to your local store to purchase your “starter plant” that will thrive in your only really sunny room or even that shady corner. With our help, you will be guided through caring for your new plant. Now, let’s get that green-thumb confidence back!

                    <h2>Let's shed some light on the situation</h2>
                        <p>Who knew lighting could  be complicated? We are here to simplify it.</p>
                            <h3>High Light [full sun or direct light]</h3>
                                <p>This type of light comes from southern-facing windows. It is light that is unobstructed by things like curtains, blinds or even trees. You may notice that your cat or dog loves basking in the sun in front of one of these windows. </p>
                            <h3>Medium Light [bright indirect]</h3>
                                <p>This in-between lighting comes from direct exposure from eastern or western-facing windows. Southern-facing windows that are filtered (meaning there are curtains, blinds or trees blocking some of the sunlight) and southwestern-facing windows can also produce this light. </p>
                            <h3>Low Light [indirect light]</h3>
                                <p>Northern-facing windows have the least amount of light, so this is where low light comes from. Areas that are far away (multiple feet) from any windows can also be considered indirect light or low-light. </p>
                    <h2>What type of light do you have the most of? If it's:</h2>
                            <h3>High Light: Jade Plant</h3>

                                    <dt>potting:</dt> <dd>Use an all-purpose potting mix and combine it with perlite for good drainage. Repot only every two years into a pot that is one size larger than the original pot. 
                                    </dd>
                                    <dt>other information:</dt> <dd>If you purchase a young jade plant, keep it out of completely direct sun until it gets a bit bigger, then it will thrive off the sun's rays! 
                                    </dd>

                                    <dt>watering:</dt> <dd> Let the soil dry out between waterings, about every two weeks.

                                    <dt>potting:</dt> <dd>Use an indoor-potting mix and combine with perlite and peat moss for drainage and moisture retention. Since pothos grow fast, you can repot it every year into a pot one size larger than the original pot.</dd>
                                    <dt>other information:</dt> <dd>If the leaves are turning yellow, it may mean they got a sunburn, ouch! Remember, medium light is perfect for them.

                                    <dt>watering:</dt> <dd> The top two-thirds of the soil must be dried out before watering again, about every week to ten days. If you are overwatering it will let you know: brown marks will appear on the leaves.
                                    </dd>
                                    <dt>potting:</dt> <dd>Use a mix of indoor potting mix and perlite and repot only after 3 or four years.</dd>
                                    <dt>other information:</dt> <dd>IThis plant can tolerate any lighting condition but does not like to be disturbed (I think we can all relate to this).

                    <h2>Need a little extra help? [We won't tell]</h2>
                            <h3>Pot Size</h3>
                                <p>When getting your new plant, be sure to get a pot that is a good fit for your plant: not too big and not too small. A big pot will cause root rot because the soil can’t dry out as efficiently and a small pot won't allow your plant the space it needs to grow. </p>
                            <h3>Moisture Meter</h3>
                                <p>Still unsure when to water your plant? Get a moisture meter! These tools allow you to determine the amount of water present in your plant’s soil without having to get your hands dirty.</p>
                            <h3>Dust-Free Leaves</h3>
                                <p>Notice some dust on your plant’s leaves? Make sure you clean them up. A buildup of dust can block out the sun and will stress out your plants, and you. Clean leaves monthly or whenever you notice them getting dusty with a microfiber cloth and water or even a house duster.</p>
                            <h3>Plant Stake</h3>
                                <p>Your plants may need some extra support, especially when they grow big and tall. If needed, you can purchase a stake for your plant to get some extra help.</p>
                            <h3>Fertilizer</h3>
                                <p>If your plant is still a baby, make sure you give it standard liquid fertilizer every two weeks during its growth phase. </p>
