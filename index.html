                    <p>Well, we’ve got you covered. We know how frustrating it can be to spend tons of money on plants, just to watch them wither. For your sake (and your plants) we will help you assess your home's lighting. Then, head to your local store to purchase your “starter plant” that will thrive in your only really sunny room or even that shady corner. With our help, you will be guided through caring for your new plant. Now, let’s get that green-thumb confidence back!

                                <p>This type of light comes from southern-facing windows. It is light that is unobstructed by things like curtains, blinds or even trees. You may notice that your cat or dog loves basking in the sun in front of one of these windows. </p> </section>
                            <section><h3 id="medium">Medium Light [bright indirect]</h3>
                                <p>This in-between lighting comes from direct exposure from eastern or western-facing windows. Southern-facing windows that are filtered (meaning there are curtains, blinds or trees blocking some of the sunlight) and southwestern-facing windows can also produce this light. </p> </section>
                            <section><h3 id="low">Low Light [indirect light]</h3>
                                <p>Northern-facing windows have the least amount of light, so this is where low light comes from. Areas that are far away (multiple feet) from any windows can also be considered indirect light or low-light. </p></section>

                            <h3>Pot Size</h3>
                                <p>When getting your new plant, be sure to get a pot that is a good fit for your plant: not too big and not too small. A big pot will cause root rot because the soil can’t dry out as efficiently and a small pot won't allow your plant the space it needs to grow. </p>
                            <h3>Moisture Meter</h3>
                                <p>Still unsure when to water your plant? Get a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/XLUX-Moisture-Indicator-Hygrometer-Gardening/dp/B099R6BQHB/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2Z18YH7TC1S7J&keywords=moisture%2Bmeter&qid=1681836320&sprefix=moisture%2Bmeter%2Caps%2C101&sr=8-1-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExM1E5WUhDS0w5MjY4JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUExMDM1OTU4MzZWQ0gzQkpQUUtHNCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNzUwOTY4MVdNMlFMSktHMUVIMyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU&th=1">moisture meter</a>! These tools allow you to determine the amount of water present in your plant’s soil without having to get your hands dirty.</p>
                            <h3>Dust-Free Leaves</h3>
                                <p>Notice some dust on your plant’s leaves? Make sure you clean them up. A buildup of dust can block out the sun and will stress out your plants, and you. Clean leaves monthly or whenever you notice them getting dusty with a microfiber cloth and water or even a house duster.</p>
                            <h3>Plant Stake</h3>
                                <p>Your plants may need some extra support, especially when they grow big and tall. If needed, you can purchase a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LMAIVE-Monstera-Bendable-Support-Climbing/dp/B09Z25YQ5T/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3XSDN9XDAEY6&keywords=plant%2Bstake&qid=1681837654&sprefix=plant%2Bstake%2Caps%2C136&sr=8-1-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzN1lWMEI3UENOSjhVJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTk1MDQ1M082MkkzSEhDSVBXMiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNzkzMTA3M0QxUEhWNzNNRzVLNSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU&th=1">stake</a> for your plant to get some extra help.</p>
                            <h3>Fertilizer</h3>
                                <p>If your plant is still a baby, make sure you give it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-Gro-1001502-Concentrate-32-Ounce-Fertilizer/dp/B000RNENU8/ref=sr_1_16?crid=2C7R2IXPGHP85&keywords=standard+fertilizer+liquid&qid=1681843049&sprefix=standard+fertilizer+liquid+%2Caps%2C75&sr=8-16">standard liquid fertilizer</a> every two weeks during its growth phase.</p>
