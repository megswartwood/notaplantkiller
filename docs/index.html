                    <p>Well, we’ve got you covered. We know how frustrating it can be to spend tons of money on plants, just to watch them wither. For your sake (and your plants) we will help you assess your home's lighting. Then, head to your local store to purchase your “starter plant” that will thrive in your only really sunny room or even that shady corner. With our help, you will be guided through caring for your new plant. Now, let’s get that green-thumb confidence back!

                                <p>This type of light comes from southern-facing windows. It is light that is unobstructed by things like curtains, blinds or even trees. You may notice that your cat or dog loves basking in the sun in front of one of these windows. </p> </section>

Southern-facing windows that are filtered (meaning there are curtains, blinds or trees blocking some of the sunlight) and southwestern-facing windows can also produce this light. </p> </section>

                                <p>Northern-facing windows have the least amount of light, so this is where low light comes from. Areas that are far away (multiple feet) from any windows can also be considered indirect light or low-light. </p></section>
